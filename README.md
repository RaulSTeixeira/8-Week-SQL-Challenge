This repository contains the solutions for the case studies from the **[#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**. 

The 8 Week SQL Challenge was started by Danny Ma through **[Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/)** virtual data apprenticeship program, which consists of 8 different SQL challenges.

Solved on **SQL Server** and **PostgreSQL** using several SQL techniques like conditional `WHERE` statements, data aggregation with `GROUP BY` and ordering with `ORDER BY`, `CASE WHEN` Statements, string transformations, regular expressions, datetime manipulation, common table expressions (CTE), subqueries and nested queries, complex table joins, temporary tables, **recursive CTEs** and **window functions**.

Some cases include **duplicate pre-processing**, **exploratory data analysis** (EDA) and **summary statistics**.
